# NHS Waiting List Analytics

**Period:** April 2019 to December 2025 (project scope) | **Data:** NHS England Referral to Treatment (RTT) statistics | **Tools:** Python, MySQL, SQL, Databricks, Power BI and DAX

## The research question

> **Are changes in NHS waiting lists driven by improvements in treatment capacity, or by changes in the number of patients starting treatment pathways?**

**What I found:** The project's historical analysis shows that the waiting list contracted during the early COVID-19 period when new RTT pathways fell sharply, then expanded substantially as demand returned. The existing project summary reports approximately **4.4 million** patients waiting before COVID, **3.2 million** during the early pandemic and **7.5 million** in FY 2024/25. This pattern raises an important analytical distinction: a falling waiting list does not necessarily indicate that more patients are being treated. However, these comparisons alone do not prove that referral suppression was the dominant cause in every period.

**How I investigated it:** I used NHS England's published RTT files to analyse incomplete pathways, treatment activity and new RTT clock starts across reporting periods. Python scripts process the source Excel publications into standardised datasets; a MySQL dimensional model and Databricks SQL workflows support time-series and trust-level comparisons. The repository also contains DAX measures and specifications for a Power BI reporting model.

**Why it matters:** Waiting-list performance needs to be interpreted alongside both incoming pathways and completed treatments. Looking only at the waiting-list total can obscure changes in access and demand.

These approximate figures come from the project's existing analysis and have **not been independently recalculated for this README revision**. The columns compare different kinds of periods, so they should not be treated as like-for-like monthly averages without checking the underlying definitions. New RTT periods are *clock starts*, not exclusively GP referrals. See the [full project documentation](PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md) for assumptions, calculations and context.

## Power BI dashboard

**Dashboard publication pending.** The repository includes a [Power BI DAX and report specification](powerbi/measures.md), but no verified published dashboard link or report-page screenshots.

The designed reporting views cover national waiting-list trends, referral and treatment activity, long waits, regional performance and trust comparisons. Genuine report screenshots and a verified link will be added when available.

## Data architecture

The project combines Python extraction and transformation with a MySQL reporting model and a parallel Databricks Delta Lake track. For schemas, staging, analytical views and implementation details, see [Project Documentation](PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md).
